<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Thermal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentrated Solar Thermal</li><li>Non-Concentrated Solar Thermal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar thermal market is divided into two main types: Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) and Non-Concentrated Solar Thermal (NCS). CST systems use mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a small area, generating high temperatures for power generation or industrial processes. In contrast, NCS systems, like solar water heaters, harness solar energy for direct heating applications without concentrating sunlight. Both markets contribute to renewable energy solutions, with CST primarily focused on large-scale power plants and NCS serving residential and commercial heating needs.</p></p>
