<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Network Diode Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional</li><li>Bidirectional</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The network diode market comprises two main types: unidirectional and bidirectional. Unidirectional network diodes allow data to flow in only one direction, enhancing security by preventing external access to sensitive networks. This is ideal for critical infrastructure and secure environments. In contrast, bidirectional network diodes facilitate data transfer in both directions, enabling controlled communication while still maintaining a level of security. This type is valuable for environments that require data exchange between systems while mitigating risks.</p></p>
