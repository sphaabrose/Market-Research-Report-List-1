<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coffee Crystals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray Drying</li><li>Freeze Drying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coffee crystals market encompasses two main types: spray drying and freeze drying. Spray drying involves rapidly transforming liquid coffee into powder by spraying it into hot air, resulting in smaller, uniform particles with a shorter processing time, which enhances production efficiency. In contrast, freeze drying preserves the coffee's aroma and flavor by first freezing the liquid coffee, then removing moisture in a vacuum. This method yields higher-quality crystals, although it is more time-consuming and expensive. Both types cater to diverse consumer preferences in instant coffee products.</p></p>
